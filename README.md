# Movies-Correlation-Project

Welcome to the Movies Correlation Project!

For this project I used python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, calculate, and visualized the Movies dataset to find out the trends and correlations between certain factors vs gross earnings.

The environment that was used for this project is Jupyter Notebook.
